#Saveyour Release Notes
## Beta Release - Wednesday April 1, 2015
### Log-in
TLS Certificate was added to supply a secure connection between the client and the server. Pressing tab/enter in the username field will allow one to jump to the password field. You must click Add Certificate before being able to log in.
### Quick Notes Module
Quicknotes module created and is able to be resized. Exiting the module causes the application to save the user data to the server as well as locally
### Weekly To-Do Module
Weekly To-Do module created and is able to add tasks for each day of the week. Window can be resized only horizontally.
### Settings Module
Buttons in the settings should be able to show/hide modules. Showing and hiding the modules does not destroy the process, it keeps it running which is one of the key aspects behind Saveyour. 

### Known Issues
#### Known Issue #1: Weekly To-Do has limited functionality
Weekly To-Do can only have one task per day display at a time. The days also seemed to be cramped. There is also no option to resize it vertically which is something that needs to be worked on for the final release.
#### Known Issue #2: No loading modules sign
When logging in, it may take a few seconds before seeing the modules load. There is no visual feedback to tell the user this so one may think that the app has crashed. 
#### Known Issue #3: Settings Module does not have show/hide for all of the modules
The settings module does not have show/hide for all of the modules. Also, other than showing/hiding, the settings module is limited so far. This will be changed in the final release.

## Alpha Release - Monday March 9, 2015
